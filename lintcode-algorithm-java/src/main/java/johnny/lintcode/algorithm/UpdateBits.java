/**
 * Update Bits.
 * Given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j.
 * Write a method to set all bits between i and j in N equal to M
 * (e g , M becomes a substring of N located at i and starting at j)
 * <p>
 * Example
 * Given N=(10000000000)2, M=(10101)2, i=2, j=6
 * return N=(10001010100)2
 * <p>
 * Note
 * In the function, the numbers N and M will given in decimal, you should also return a decimal number.
 * <p>
 * Challenge
 * Minimum number of operations?
 * <p>
 * Clarification
 * You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M.
 * That is, if M=10011ï¼Œ you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j
 * and i. You would not, for example, have j=3 and i=2, because M could not
 * fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.
