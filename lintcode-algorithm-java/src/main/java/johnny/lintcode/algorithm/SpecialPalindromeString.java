/**
 * Special Palindrome String
 * You have a list of paired ambigram letter, like a<->t, b<->y, y<->h, h<->n, m<->w, w<->w â€¦
 * Given a string, return true if it is a palindrome string which letters in it can be replaced by another corresponding letters. Attentionally, nested replacement is not be allowed, which means a<-->b, b<-->c, but a<-/->c.
 *
 * For example, the string "swims" is true because "w" can be replaced by "m" and the string changes to "smims" which is palindrome.
 * the string "hob" is also true because "h" can be replaced by "y" and "b" can be replaced to "y" too. Then the string is "yoy" which is palindrome.
 * However, the string "ban" is false because nested replacement is not be allowed. Even "b" can just change to "y" and "n" can just change to "h" , the new string "yah" isn't palindrome.
 *
 * Each digit of list ambigram is 2 letters, indicating that it can be converted from one to the other.
 * The length of list ambigram does not exceed 10,000
 * The length of the string word does not exceed 1,000
 * All data are guaranteed to be lowercase.
 *
 * Have you met this question in a real interview?
 * Example
 * Example 1:
 * Input: ambigram=["at", "by", "yh", "hn", "mw", "ww"], word="swims"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: "w" can be replaced by "m" and the string changes to "smims" which is palindrome, so it is true.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: ambigram=["at", "by", "yh", "hn", "mw", "ww"], word="hob"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: "h" can be replaced by "y" and "b" can be replaced to "y" too. Then the string is "yoy" which is palindrome, so it is true.
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: ambigram=["at", "by", "yh", "hn", "mw", "ww"], word="ban"
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: Nested replacement is not be allowed. Even "b" can just change to "y" and "n" can just change to "h" , the new string "yah" isn't palindrome.
