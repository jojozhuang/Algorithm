/**
 * 1109. Corporate Flight Bookings
 * <p>
 * There are n flights, and they are labeled from 1 to n.
 * <p>
 * We have a list of flight bookings.  The i-th booking bookings[i] = [i, j, k] means that we booked k seats from flights labeled i to j inclusive.
 * <p>
 * Return an array answer of length n, representing the number of seats booked on each flight in order of their label.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: bookings = [[1,2,10],[2,3,20],[2,5,25]], n = 5
 * Output: [10,55,45,25,25]
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= bookings.length <= 20000
 * 1 <= bookings[i][0] <= bookings[i][1] <= n <= 20000
 * 1 <= bookings[i][2] <= 10000
