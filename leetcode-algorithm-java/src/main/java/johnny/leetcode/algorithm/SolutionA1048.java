/**
 * 1048. Longest String Chain
 * Given a list of words, each word consists of English lowercase letters.
 * <p>
 * Let's say word1 is a predecessor of word2 if and only if we can add exactly one letter anywhere in word1 to make it equal to word2.  For example, "abc" is a predecessor of "abac".
 * <p>
 * A word chain is a sequence of words [word_1, word_2, ..., word_k] with {@code k >= 1}, where word_1 is a predecessor of word_2, word_2 is a predecessor of word_3, and so on.
 * <p>
 * Return the longest possible length of a word chain with words chosen from the given list of words.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * Input: ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: one of the longest word chain is "a","ba","bda","bdca".
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <pre>{@code
 * 1 <= words.length <= 1000
 * 1 <= words[i].length <= 16
 * words[i] only consists of English lowercase letters.
 * }</pre>
