/**
 * 1104. Path In Zigzag Labelled Binary Tree
 * In an infinite binary tree where every node has two children, the nodes are labelled in row order.
 * <p>
 * In the odd numbered rows (ie., the first, third, fifth,...), the labelling is left to right, while in the even numbered rows (second, fourth, sixth,...), the labelling is right to left.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Given the label of a node in this tree, return the labels in the path from the root of the tree to the node with that label.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: label = 14
 * Output: [1,3,4,14]
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: label = 26
 * Output: [1,2,6,10,26]
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= label <= 10^6
