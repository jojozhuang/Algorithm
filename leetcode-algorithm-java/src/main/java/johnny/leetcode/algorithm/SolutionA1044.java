/**
 * 1044. Longest Duplicate Substring
 * Given a string S, consider all duplicated substrings: (contiguous) substrings of S that occur 2 or more times.  (The occurrences may overlap.)
 * <p>
 * Return any duplicated substring that has the longest possible length.  (If S does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is "".)
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * Input: "banana"
 * Output: "ana"
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * Input: "abcd"
 * Output: ""
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <pre>{@code
 * 2 <= S.length <= 10^5
 * S consists of lowercase English letters.
 * }</pre>
