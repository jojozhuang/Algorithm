/**
 * 1053. Previous Permutation With One Swap
 * Given an array A of positive integers (not necessarily distinct), return the lexicographically largest permutation that is smaller than A, that can be made with one swap (A swap exchanges the positions of two numbers A[i] and A[j]).  If it cannot be done, then return the same array.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [3,2,1]
 * Output: [3,1,2]
 * Explanation: Swapping 2 and 1.
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * Input: [1,1,5]
 * Output: [1,1,5]
 * Explanation: This is already the smallest permutation.
 * <p>
 * Example 3:
 * Input: [1,9,4,6,7]
 * Output: [1,7,4,6,9]
 * Explanation: Swapping 9 and 7.
 * <p>
 * Example 4:
 * Input: [3,1,1,3]
 * Output: [1,3,1,3]
 * Explanation: Swapping 1 and 3.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <pre>{@code
 * 1 <= A.length <= 10000
 * 1 <= A[i] <= 10000
 * }</pre>
