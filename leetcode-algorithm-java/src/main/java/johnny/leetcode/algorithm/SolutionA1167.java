/**
 * 1167. Minimum Cost to Connect Sticks
 * You have some sticks with positive integer lengths.
 * <p>
 * You can connect any two sticks of lengths X and Y into one stick by paying a cost of X + Y.  You perform this action until there is one stick remaining.
 * <p>
 * Return the minimum cost of connecting all the given sticks into one stick in this way.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: sticks = [2,4,3]
 * Output: 14
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: sticks = [1,8,3,5]
 * Output: 30
