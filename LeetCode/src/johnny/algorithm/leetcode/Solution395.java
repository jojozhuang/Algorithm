/**
 * Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters   
 * 
 * Find the length of the longest substring T of a given string (consists of 
 * lowercase letters only) such that every character in T appears no less than k 
 * times.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * s = "aaabb", k = 3
 * Output:
 * 3
 * The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input:
 * s = "ababbc", k = 2
 * Output:
 * 5
 * The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is 
 * repeated 3 times.
