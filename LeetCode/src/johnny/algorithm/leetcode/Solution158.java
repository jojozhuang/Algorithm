/**
 * Read N Characters Given Read4 II - Call multiple times.
 * 
 * The API: int read4(char *buf) reads 4 characters at a time from a file.
 * The return value is the actual number of characters read. For example, it 
 * returns 3 if there is only 3 characters left in the file.
 * 
 * By using the read4 API, implement the function int read(char *buf, int n) 
 * that reads n characters from the file.
 * 
 * Note: The read function may be called multiple times.
