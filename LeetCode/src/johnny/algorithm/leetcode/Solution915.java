/**
 * 915. Partition Array into Disjoint Intervals

Given an array A, partition it into two (contiguous) subarrays left and right so that:

Every element in left is less than or equal to every element in right.
left and right are non-empty.
left has the smallest possible size.
Return the length of left after such a partitioning.  It is guaranteed that such a partitioning exists.

 

Example 1:

Input: [5,0,3,8,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: left = [5,0,3], right = [8,6]
Example 2:

Input: [1,1,1,0,6,12]
Output: 4
Explanation: left = [1,1,1,0], right = [6,12]
 

Note:

2 <= A.length <= 30000
0 <= A[i] <= 10^6
It is guaranteed there is at least one way to partition A as described.
