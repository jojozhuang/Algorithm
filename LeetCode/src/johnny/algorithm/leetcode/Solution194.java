/**
 * 194. Transpose File
 * Given a text file file.txt, transpose its content.

You may assume that each row has the same number of columns and each field is separated by the ' ' character.

For example, if file.txt has the following content:

name age
alice 21
ryan 30
Output the following:

name alice ryan
age 21 30
 * @author Johnny
 */
public class Solution194 {
    //# Read from the file file.txt and print its transposed content to stdout.
}
