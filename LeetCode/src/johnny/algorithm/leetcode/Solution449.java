/**
 * Serialize and Deserialize BST
 * 
 * Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into 
 * a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or 
 * transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in 
 * the same or another computer environment.
 * 
 * Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. There 
 * is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should 
 * work. You just need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to 
 * a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
 * 
 * The encoded string should be as compact as possible.
