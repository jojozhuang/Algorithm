/**
 * Maximum Subarray.
 * Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number)
 * which has the largest sum.
 * 
 * For example, given the array [−2,1,−3,4,−1,2,1,−5,4],
 * the contiguous subarray [4,−1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

 * More practice:
 * 
 * If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using
 * the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.
