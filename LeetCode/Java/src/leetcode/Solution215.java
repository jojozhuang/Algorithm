/**
 * Kth Largest Element in an Array.
 * 
 * Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth 
 * largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
 * 
 * For example,
 * Given [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2, return 5.
 * 
 * In array [1,2,3,4,5], the 1st largest element is 5,
 * 2nd largest element is 4, 3rd largest element is 3 and etc.
 *  
 * Note: 
 * You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.
 * You can swap elements in the array
 * 
 * Challenge
 * O(n) time, O(1) extra memory.
