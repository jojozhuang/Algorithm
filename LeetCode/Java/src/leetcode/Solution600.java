/**
 * Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones
 * 
 * Given a positive integer n, find the number of non-negative integers less 
 * than or equal to n, whose binary representations do NOT contain consecutive ones.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: 5
 * Output: 5
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * Here are the non-negative integers <= 5 with their corresponding binary representations:
 * 0 : 0
 * 1 : 1
 * 2 : 10
 * 3 : 11
 * 4 : 100
 * 5 : 101
 * Among them, only integer 3 disobeys the rule (two consecutive ones) and the other 5 satisfy the rule. 
 * 
 * Note: 1 <= n <= 109
