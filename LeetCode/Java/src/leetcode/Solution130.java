/**
 * Surrounded Regions.
 * Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
 * 
 * A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
 * 
 * For example,
 * X X X X
 * X O O X
 * X X O X
 * X O X X
 * After running your function, the board should be:
 * 
 * X X X X
 * X X X X
 * X X X X
 * X O X X
