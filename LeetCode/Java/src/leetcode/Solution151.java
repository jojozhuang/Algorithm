/**
 * Reverse Words in a String.
 * Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.
 * 
 * For example,
 * Given s = "the sky is blue",
 * return "blue is sky the".
 * 
 * Update (2015-02-12):
 * For C programmers: Try to solve it in-place in O(1) space.
 * 
 * Clarification:
 *  1. What constitutes a word?
 *     A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.
 *  2. Could the input string contain leading or trailing spaces?
 *     Yes. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
 *  3. How about multiple spaces between two words?
 *     Reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.
