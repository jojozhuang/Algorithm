/**
 * Minimum Absolute Difference in BST
 * 
 * Given a binary search tree with non-negative values, find the minimum 
 * absolute difference between values of any two nodes.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Input:
 * 
 *  1
 *   \
 *    3
 *   /
 *  2
 * 
 * Output:
 * 1
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * The minimum absolute difference is 1, which is the difference between 2 and 
 * 1 (or between 2 and 3).
 * 
 * Note: There are at least two nodes in this BST.
