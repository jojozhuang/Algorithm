/**
 * Linked List Random Node
 * 
 * Given a singly linked list, return a random node's value from the linked list. 
 * Each node must have the same probability of being chosen.
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * What if the linked list is extremely large and its length is unknown to you? 
 * Could you solve this efficiently without using extra space
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * // Init a singly linked list [1,2,3].
 * ListNode head = new ListNode(1);
 * head.next = new ListNode(2);
 * head.next.next = new ListNode(3);
 * Solution solution = new Solution(head);
 * 
 * // getRandom() should return either 1, 2, or 3 randomly. Each element should 
 * have equal probability of returning.
 * 
 * solution.getRandom();
 *
