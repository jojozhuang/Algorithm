/**
 * Next Greater Element II
 * 
 * Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first 
 * element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. 
 * The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its
 * traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly
 * to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this 
 * number.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [1,2,1]
 * Output: [2,-1,2]
 * Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
 * The number 2 can't find next greater number; 
 * The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
 * 
 * Note: The length of given array won't exceed 10000.
