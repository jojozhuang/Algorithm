/**
 *Given a non-empty integer array of size n, find the minimum number of moves 
 * required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing 
 * n - 1 elements by 1.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Input:
 * [1,2,3]
 * 
 * Output:
 * 3
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):
 * 
 * [1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]
