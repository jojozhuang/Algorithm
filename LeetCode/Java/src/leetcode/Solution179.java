/**
 * Largest Number.
 * Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them such that they form the 
 * largest number.
 * 
 * For example, given [3, 30, 34, 5, 9], the largest formed number is 9534330.
 * 
 * Note: The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead
 * of an integer.
