 * Maximum Gap.
 * Given an unsorted array, find the maximum difference between the successive 
 * elements in its sorted form.
 * 
 * Try to solve it in linear time/space.
 * 
 * Return 0 if the array contains less than 2 elements.
 * 
 * You may assume all elements in the array are non-negative integers and fit 
 * in the 32-bit signed integer range.
