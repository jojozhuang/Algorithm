/**
 * Word Pattern II.
 * Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.
 * 
 * Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a 
 * letter in pattern and a non-empty substring in str.
 * 
 * Examples:
 * 
 * pattern = "abab", str = "redblueredblue" should return true.
 * pattern = "aaaa", str = "asdasdasdasd" should return true.
 * pattern = "aabb", str = "xyzabcxzyabc" should return false. 
 * Notes:
 * You may assume both pattern and str contains only lowercase letters.
