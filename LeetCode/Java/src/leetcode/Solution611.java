/**
 * Valid Triangle Number
 * 
 * Given an array consists of non-negative integers, your task is to count the 
 * number of triplets chosen from the array that can make triangles if we take 
 * them as side lengths of a triangle.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [2,2,3,4]
 * Output: 3
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * Valid combinations are: 
 * 2,3,4 (using the first 2)
 * 2,3,4 (using the second 2)
 * 2,2,3
 * 
 * Note:
 * 1. The length of the given array won't exceed 1000.
 * 2. The integers in the given array are in the range of [0, 1000].
