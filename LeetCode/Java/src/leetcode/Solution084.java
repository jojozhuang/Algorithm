/**
 * Largest Rectangle in Histogram.
 * Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where 
 * the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.
 * 
 * Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].
 * 
 * The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.
 * 
 * For example,
 * Given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3],
 * return 10.
